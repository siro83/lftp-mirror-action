### Fingerprint

Omitting the `fingerprint` input, defaults to accepting any fingerprint
(i.e. automatically adding the host/port to the `known_hosts` file)

### Restoring modification times

:warning: Read this section if `lftp-mirror-action` uploads _all_ files every time it runs.

Git does not preserve the original modification time of committed files.
When repositories are cloned, branches are checked out, etc., the modification time
of the files is updated to the current time. This means that the modification time
of the files on the GitHub runner will always be newer than the files on the SFTP server,
which will result in the `mirror` command always uploading all files (since `lftp` determines
whether a file has changed based on its file size and timestamp).

To prevent this, if `onlyNewer` is set to `true`, we restore the modification time of the files
based on the date of the most recent commit that modified them. You can disable this behavior
by setting `restoreMTime` to `false` (useful if you've already run an action like
[`git-restore-mtime-action`](https://github.com/chetan/git-restore-mtime-action)
in your GitHub Actions workflow).

If you're using [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) â‰¥ `v2` you _must_ set
`fetch-depth` to `0` in order to fetch the entire Git history.
